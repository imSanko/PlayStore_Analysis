### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```python
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```
Running the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/imSanko/PlayStore_Analysis.git
```
# Open the Jupyter Notebook (IPython) file named "Playstore_Analysis.ipynb" in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Execute the cells in the notebook one by one to perform the data analysis tasks.

The notebook includes tasks such as data import, data imputation, and filtering apps based on categories and ratings.

The results of the analysis are displayed within the notebook.

# Analysis Tasks
The following analysis tasks are performed in the notebook:

1. Data is imported from the "googleplaystore.csv" file.

2. Missing values in the "Rating" column are imputed with the mean value.

3. The notebook identifies the number of free apps in the "ART_AND_DESIGN" category.

4. The notebook identifies the number of apps in the "ART_AND_DESIGN" category with a rating greater than 4.5.

5. The notebook identifies the number of free apps in the "ART_AND_DESIGN" category with a rating greater than 4.5.

6. Finally, the notebook lists the names of free apps in the "ART_AND_DESIGN" category with a rating greater than 4.5.
